This image depicts a glazed brick relief panel from the Ishtar Gate, a monumental entrance to the inner city of Babylon, dating back to the Neo-Babylonian period, specifically during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, around 575 BCE. The context is architectural decoration, serving as part of the grand processional way leading to the gate. The purpose was to visually assert the power and grandeur of the Babylonian Empire, with the striding lion symbolizing royal strength and protection. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Babylonian, and while the lion itself is a symbolic representation rather than a historical character, it embodies the power associated with Nebuchadnezzar II, known for his ambitious building projects in Babylon. The glazed brick technique and the depiction of lions reflect the artistic style and cultural significance of these animals in Babylonian iconography.
