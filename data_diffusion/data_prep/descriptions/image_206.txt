This image depicts a golden statue, likely representing a deity or a royal figure, being worshipped by a crowd of people. The context suggests a scene from the Babylonian culture, possibly related to the story of the golden image erected by King Nebuchadnezzar II, as described in the Book of Daniel. The purpose of the artwork appears to be illustrative, aiming to visually represent a biblical narrative or a historical account of Babylonian religious practices. The period depicted would be the Neo-Babylonian Empire, around the 6th century BCE. The culture is Babylonian, and the historical character, if based on the biblical account, would be Nebuchadnezzar II, known for his architectural and political achievements in Babylon. The image highlights the grandeur and religious significance attributed to such figures within the Babylonian context.
