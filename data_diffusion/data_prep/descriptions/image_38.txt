This image, titled 'La Paix entre les Romains et les Sabins' ('The Peace Between the Romans and the Sabines'), is a print depicting the aftermath of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the Sabine women intervene to stop the fighting between their husbands and fathers. The purpose of this work was likely to illustrate a historical event, reflecting the artistic trends and tastes of the Baroque period in 17th-century France. The culture is French, with a strong interest in classical Roman history and its moral lessons. The central historical characters are the Sabine women, shown intervening to stop the fighting, and the Roman and Sabine warriors. The print captures the emotional intensity and chaotic violence of the scene, with the figures' gestures and expressions conveying a sense of sorrow, duty, and reconciliation. The classical setting and attire add to the historical context and drama of the event. The inscription at the bottom indicates it is from the 'Biblioth√®que nationale de France,' suggesting it is part of a historical collection.
