This image depicts a decorative totem pole, a cultural artifact traditionally associated with the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America, not Mayan culture. The totem pole features stacked figures and animal crests, each carrying symbolic meanings related to family lineage, mythology, or important events within the community. The purpose of totem poles was multifaceted, serving as markers of territory, records of history, or symbols of social status. The period of creation for traditional totem poles spans several centuries, with the oldest known examples dating back to the 18th century. Given the distinct iconography and cultural context, this image does not align with Mayan culture, which flourished in Mesoamerica. The misattribution might stem from a misunderstanding of cultural origins or a broader interest in indigenous art forms.
