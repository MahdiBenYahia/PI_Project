This image, likely titled 'Stele with Decorative Patterns,' depicts a weathered stone carving with geometric and stylized patterns, possibly a funerary or votive monument. The stele features a series of circular motifs along the top edge, resembling spirals or coils, while the lower portion displays a more abstract design, possibly representing a stylized figure or object. The carving is executed in a shallow relief, suggesting a symbolic or decorative purpose. The period and culture are likely ancient Mediterranean, possibly Punic or a related civilization, given the style and the material. The location, Kelaat El Andalous, Tunisia, a region with a rich Punic history, further supports this cultural context. While specific historical characters are not identifiable, the stele suggests a connection to ritualistic or commemorative practices in the ancient world. The carving's craftsmanship and the use of stone point to a culture with a developed artistic tradition and a strong connection to symbolism.
