Titre: Rock Crystal Bowl

Description: Five rock crystal works found in a cistern in Carthage (now in Tunisia, North Africa) demonstrate the quality of the arts of that great city as the Roman world became Byzantine. The Roman naturalist Pliny, describing its beauty, believed crystal to come from snow. It was thought to protect against kidney ailments and other diseases.
