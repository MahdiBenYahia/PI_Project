This painting, titled 'Coriolanus Taking Leave of his Family,' was created by the French artist Nicolas Poussin. It depicts a scene from Roman history, specifically the story of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, a Roman general who was persuaded by his mother and wife to spare Rome from his vengeful attack. The purpose of this work was likely to portray a dramatic and moralizing moment from classical history, reflecting the artistic trends and tastes of the Baroque period in 17th-century France. The culture is French, with a strong interest in classical Roman history and its moral lessons. The central historical characters are Coriolanus, shown taking leave of his family, including his mother Veturia and his wife Volumnia. The painting captures the emotional intensity of the scene, with the figures' gestures and expressions conveying a sense of sorrow, duty, and familial affection. The classical setting and attire add to the historical context and drama of the event.
