Titre: Mosaic with the "Lady of Carthage"

Description: This image depicts a mosaic, likely the "Lady of Carthage," housed in the Carthage National Museum, located in Tunis, Tunisia. It represents Byzantine art, a style that flourished in the Eastern Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire. The purpose of such mosaics was often decorative, intended to adorn public or private spaces, and potentially served a religious or symbolic function. Created during the Byzantine period, which spanned from the 4th to 15th centuries, the mosaic reflects the artistic culture of that era. While it's difficult to confirm specific historical characters without more context, the style and location suggest it's a representation of a noble or important figure from that time.
