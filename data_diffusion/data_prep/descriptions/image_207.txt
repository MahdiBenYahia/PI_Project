This image features a cylinder seal and its corresponding impression, a hallmark of the Uruk period in Mesopotamian culture, dating back to the late 4th millennium BCE. The seal, carved with intricate designs, would have been rolled over wet clay to create a repeating pattern, serving as a form of signature or authentication. The context suggests a scene related to pastoral life or religious symbolism, possibly depicting deities or figures associated with livestock, such as Inanna and Dumuzid. The purpose of these seals was likely administrative or ritualistic, used to mark ownership or to invoke divine protection. The culture represented is Sumerian, and the figures depicted, if interpreted as deities, could include Inanna, the goddess of love and war, and Dumuzid, her consort, associated with fertility and agriculture. These seals provide valuable insights into the beliefs and practices of the early Mesopotamian civilization.
