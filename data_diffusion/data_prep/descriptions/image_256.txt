This image combines a sculpted head with a background featuring a relief of a striding lion, both elements indicative of the Neo-Assyrian period, specifically from the palace of Sargon II in Dur-Sharrukin, dating back to the 8th century BCE. The context is a montage of royal art, intended to glorify the king and depict scenes of power and ritual. The purpose was to visually communicate the might and divine favor of the Assyrian rulers. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Assyrian, and the figures likely represent a royal attendant or a supernatural being, showcasing the stylized beards and intricate details characteristic of Assyrian sculpture. The lion relief suggests themes of strength and protection. These combined elements served as narrative devices, visually reinforcing the king's authority and historical accounts of his reign.
