This image depicts a glazed brick relief panel from the Ishtar Gate, a monumental entrance to the inner city of Babylon, dating back to the Neo-Babylonian period, specifically during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, around 575 BCE. The context is architectural decoration, serving as part of the grand processional way leading to the gate. The purpose was to visually assert the power and grandeur of the Babylonian Empire, with the Sirrush (a mythical creature with a snake-like body, scales, and a horned head) symbolizing the god Marduk and royal protection. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Babylonian, and while the Sirrush itself is a symbolic representation rather than a historical character, it embodies the religious and cultural significance of Marduk, the patron deity of Babylon, and his association with Nebuchadnezzar II, known for his ambitious building projects in Babylon. The glazed brick technique and the depiction of the Sirrush reflect the artistic style and cultural significance of these animals in Babylonian iconography.
