This image depicts the Lion of Babylon, a significant artifact from the Neo-Babylonian period, circa 6th century BCE, under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. The context is a historical photograph, likely taken during an archaeological expedition or early exploration of the site, showcasing the monumental sculpture and its surroundings. The purpose was to document and capture the grandeur of the artifact and its historical significance. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Babylonian, and while the lion itself is a symbolic representation rather than a historical character, it embodies the power associated with Nebuchadnezzar II, known for his architectural achievements in Babylon. The sculpture reflects the artistic style and cultural significance of lions in Babylonian iconography, representing strength and dominion.
