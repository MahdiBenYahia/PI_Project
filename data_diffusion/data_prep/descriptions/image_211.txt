This image depicts a fragment of a stone relief sculpture, likely from the Neo-Assyrian period, around the 9th to 7th centuries BCE, a culture closely associated with Babylonian civilization. The context is a royal or religious scene, possibly from a palace wall or a temple, depicting a seated figure, possibly a ruler or deity, suggesting a narrative or symbolic purpose. The purpose was likely to convey power, divinity, or historical events, reflecting the artistic and cultural expressions of the time. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Assyrian, and the figure, if a ruler, could be associated with figures like Ashurnasirpal II or Sargon II, known for their monumental art. This artifact provides insights into the artistic style and iconography of the Assyrian culture, which shared many cultural elements with Babylonia.
