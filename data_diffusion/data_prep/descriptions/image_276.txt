Titre: Oil Lamp with Angel

Description: This image features a terracotta oil lamp, potentially titled "Oil Lamp with Shepherd Motif," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. The context suggests it's a functional object used for lighting, reflecting the daily life and possibly religious practices of the time. The purpose was to provide illumination, burning oil with a wick, and potentially to express Christian symbolism through the shepherd motif. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Roman or Byzantine influence, possibly early Christian times. The culture represented is likely early Christian, drawing from Roman and Mediterranean influences. The shepherd motif, a common symbol for Christ, suggests a connection to Christianity. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted, the lamp's presence and symbol suggest a connection to the religious practices of people in early Christian Carthage. The floral border and central image are indicative of the period's artistic style.
