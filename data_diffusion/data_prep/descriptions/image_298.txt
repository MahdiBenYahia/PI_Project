Titre: Spoon

Description: This image depicts a metal spoon, potentially titled "Byzantine Spoon with Cross," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, given the location context. The context suggests it's a crafted object, reflecting the dining or possibly religious practices of the time. The purpose might have been to serve as a utensil for eating or as a ceremonial object. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style and the cross motif might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Byzantine influence, possibly early Byzantine times. The culture represented is likely Byzantine, drawing from Roman and Mediterranean artistic traditions. The cross at the end of the handle suggests a connection to Christianity, possibly indicating its use in religious ceremonies or by a Christian individual. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted, the spoon's presence and potential symbolism suggest a connection to the dining or religious practices of people in Byzantine Carthage. The metal material and the spoon's form are indicative of its craftsmanship and potential significance.
