Titre: Oil Lamp with Menorah and Christ Crushing the Serpent's Head

Description: This image shows a terracotta oil lamp, possibly titled "Oil Lamp with Figure Motif," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. The context suggests it's a functional object used for lighting, reflecting the daily life and potentially religious practices of the time. The purpose was to provide illumination, burning oil with a wick, and potentially to express religious symbolism through the central figure. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Roman or Byzantine influence, possibly early Christian times. The culture represented is likely early Christian, drawing from Roman and Mediterranean influences. The figure, possibly a saint or a representation of a religious figure, suggests a connection to Christianity. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted in a detailed manner, the lamp's presence and potential subject matter suggest a connection to the religious beliefs of people in early Christian Carthage. The decorative floral motifs and the central figure are indicative of the period's artistic style.
