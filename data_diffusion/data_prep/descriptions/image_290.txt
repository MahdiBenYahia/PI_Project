Titre: Glass head pendant

Description: This image shows a glass pendant in the form of a human face, potentially titled "Glass Face Pendant," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. The context suggests it's a small, crafted object, reflecting the artistic and possibly symbolic practices of the time. The purpose might have been to serve as a personal adornment, an amulet, or a votive offering. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Phoenician, Punic, or Roman influence, possibly ancient times. The culture represented is likely a blend of these influences, drawing from Phoenician and Mediterranean artistic traditions. The human face, with its stylized features and glass material, suggests a connection to ancient artistic and cultural practices. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted in a detailed manner, the pendant's presence and potential symbolism suggest a connection to the beliefs and practices of people in ancient Carthage. The cracked surface and the pendant's form are indicative of its age and craftsmanship.
