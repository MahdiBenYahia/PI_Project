This image depicts a Lamassu, a protective deity from the Neo-Assyrian period, specifically from the palace of Sargon II in Dur-Sharrukin, dating back to the 8th century BCE. The context is a monumental sculpture, serving as a guardian figure at the palace entrance, intended to ward off evil and assert royal power. The purpose was to visually communicate the might and divine favor of the Assyrian rulers. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Assyrian, and the Lamassu is a mythological being, not a historical character, showcasing the stylized beards, intricate details, and composite features characteristic of Assyrian sculpture. These sculptures served as powerful symbols, visually reinforcing the king's authority and historical accounts of his reign.
