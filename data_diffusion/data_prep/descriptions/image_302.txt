Titre: Glass lentoid aryballos (perfume bottle)

Description: This image depicts a ceramic aryballos, potentially titled "Ceramic Aryballos with Spiral Handles," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, given the location context. The context suggests it's a crafted object, reflecting the daily life or possibly funerary practices of the time. The purpose might have been to serve as a container for oils or perfumes, or as a funerary offering. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Phoenician, Punic, or Roman influence, possibly ancient times. The culture represented is likely a blend of these influences, drawing from Phoenician and Mediterranean ceramic traditions. The aryballos' shape and ceramic material suggest a connection to ancient craftsmanship and daily life. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted, the aryballos' presence and potential use suggest a connection to the daily life or funerary practices of people in ancient Carthage. The spiral handles and the ceramic material are indicative of its craftsmanship and potential significance. The "lentoid" shape of the body is a characteristic feature of aryballoi. The discoloration and wear on the surface suggest its age and use.
