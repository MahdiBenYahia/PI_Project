This painting, titled 'The Plague of Ashdod,' was created by the French artist Nicolas Poussin. It depicts a scene from the Old Testament, specifically the Philistines being struck with a plague after capturing the Ark of the Covenant. The purpose of this work was likely to portray a dramatic and moralizing moment from biblical history, reflecting the artistic trends and tastes of the Baroque period in 17th-century France. The culture is French, with a strong interest in biblical narratives and their moral lessons. The painting captures the emotional intensity and chaotic violence of the scene, with the figures' gestures and expressions conveying a sense of suffering and divine retribution. The classical setting and attire add to the historical context and drama of the event. The central historical characters are the Philistines, shown being afflicted by the plague.
