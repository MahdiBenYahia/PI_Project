This image depicts a bas-relief sculpture from the Neo-Assyrian period, specifically from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud, dating back to the 9th century BCE. The context is royal art, intended to glorify the king and depict scenes of power and ritual. The purpose was to visually communicate the might and divine favor of the Assyrian rulers. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Assyrian, and the figure likely represents Ashurnasirpal II himself, showcasing the stylized beards and intricate details characteristic of Assyrian sculpture. The seated pose and ceremonial objects suggest a scene of royal authority or religious significance. These reliefs served as narrative devices, visually reinforcing the king's authority and historical accounts of his reign.
