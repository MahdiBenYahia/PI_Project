This image, likely titled 'Terracotta Bust of a Female Figure,' depicts a sculpted head with a stylized face and a head covering, possibly a representation of a goddess or a high-status woman. The bust is crafted from terracotta, a common material in ancient Mediterranean art, and features a serene expression with almond-shaped eyes and a small mouth. The head covering, which drapes around the shoulders, suggests a religious or ceremonial context. The purpose of this sculpture might have been votive, funerary, or decorative, reflecting the religious beliefs and artistic practices of its culture. The period and culture are likely ancient Mediterranean, possibly Phoenician or Punic, given the stylistic elements and the use of terracotta. The location, Kelaat El Andalous, Tunisia, suggests a possible Carthaginian or North African context, as Carthage was a major Phoenician settlement. While specific historical characters are not definitively identifiable, the sculpture's features and head covering suggest a deity or a priestess. The sculpture's craftsmanship and material point to a sophisticated artistic tradition and a culture with a rich religious and ceremonial life.
