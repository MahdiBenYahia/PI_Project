This image depicts a Mayan ceramic artifact, possibly a censer or an urn, featuring a distinctive face on the main body and an elaborate headdress on the lid. The face, with its stylized features and protruding teeth, suggests a representation of a deity or a supernatural being, indicating a ritualistic or funerary context. The headdress, with its intricate carvings and zoomorphic elements, further emphasizes the artifact's ceremonial significance. The period of origin likely falls within the Classic Maya period (c. 250-900 CE), a time of significant artistic and cultural development in Mesoamerica. While specific historical characters are difficult to identify without further context, the artifact reflects the complex religious beliefs and artistic traditions of the Mayan civilization. The inclusion of the 'CULTURA INAH' logo suggests it is a photograph taken for documentation or study by a cultural institution, highlighting its historical and archaeological significance. The ruler in the lower left corner provides scale and context.
