This image, likely titled 'Stele of the Ship MN,' depicts a weathered stone carving with a stylized depiction of a ship, possibly a merchant vessel, along with inscriptions in a script that appears to be Punic or a related ancient Mediterranean language. The ship is rendered with a curved hull and a possible eye symbol, suggesting a maritime context and possibly a protective or symbolic function. The inscriptions, though partially illegible, indicate a commemorative or votive purpose, possibly related to a voyage or a dedication to a deity. The period and culture are likely Punic, given the script and the maritime theme, reflecting the importance of seafaring in Punic civilization. The location, Kelaat El Andalous, Tunisia, a region with a rich Punic history, further supports this cultural context. While specific historical characters are not identifiable, the stele suggests a connection to maritime trade and religious practices in the Punic world. The carving's craftsmanship and the use of stone point to a culture with a developed artistic tradition and a strong connection to the sea.
