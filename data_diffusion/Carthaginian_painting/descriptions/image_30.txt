This image, likely titled 'Terracotta Figure of a Male Deity or Worshipper,' depicts a standing figure crafted from terracotta, featuring a stylized human form with a distinctive headdress. The figure has a slender build, a defined face with prominent eyes, and a beard, suggesting a male representation. The headdress, with its crown-like or fluted design, indicates a religious or ceremonial context. The figure's posture and the objects held in its hands, possibly a shell and a cup, further support a ritualistic or votive purpose. The period and culture are likely ancient Mediterranean, possibly Phoenician or Punic, given the stylistic elements and the use of terracotta. The location, Kelaat El Andalous, Tunisia, suggests a possible Carthaginian or North African context, as Carthage was a major Phoenician settlement. While specific historical characters are not definitively identifiable, the figure's features and headdress suggest a deity or a worshipper engaged in a ritual. The figure's craftsmanship and material point to a sophisticated artistic tradition and a culture with a rich religious and ceremonial life.
