This image, titled 'Then the old woman mounted on the Ifrit's back,' depicts a fantastical scene with a winged creature, possibly an Ifrit, carrying a figure on its back, set against a dark, mystical background with a pale moon. The creature, rendered in vibrant red with white and yellow accents, suggests a mythical or supernatural being. The figure on its back, possibly the old woman, is depicted in contrasting green and white, creating a striking visual contrast. The purpose of this artwork was likely to illustrate a narrative, possibly from a literary text or a folk tale, given the title and the fantastical subject matter. The period appears to be modern, given the artistic style, which resembles the work of Marc Chagall, a 20th-century artist known for his dreamlike and whimsical imagery. The culture is likely European, reflecting the artistic traditions and literary influences of the time. While specific historical characters are not identifiable, the scene evokes the imaginative and surreal qualities often found in Chagall's work, focusing on the interplay of color, form, and narrative.
