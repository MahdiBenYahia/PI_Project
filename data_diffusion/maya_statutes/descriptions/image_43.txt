This image depicts a modern artistic representation of Kukulkan, a Mayan serpent deity, characterized by its serpentine body, human torso, and feathered wings. The sculpture's purpose is likely decorative or devotional, serving as a contemporary interpretation of the ancient Mayan figure. The inclusion of the name 'Kukulkan' on the base confirms its identification. The period of creation is clearly modern, as evidenced by the style and materials, though it draws inspiration from the Classic Maya period (c. 250-900 CE), when Kukulkan was a prominent figure in Mayan mythology. While Kukulkan is a well-known deity in Mayan culture, this particular representation is a modern artistic interpretation, rather than a historical artifact. The dark background and the presence of lit candles suggest a ritualistic or display context, highlighting the sculpture's symbolic significance.
