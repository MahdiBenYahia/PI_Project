This painting, titled 'The Departure of Regulus from Rome,' was created by the British artist J.M.W. Turner. It depicts the Roman general Marcus Atilius Regulus leaving Rome to return to Carthage, where he knew he would face certain death, as he had promised the Carthaginian senate. The purpose of this work was likely to portray a dramatic and heroic moment from Roman history, reflecting the artistic trends and tastes of the Romantic period in the early 19th century. The culture is British, with a strong interest in classical Roman history and its moral lessons. The central historical character is Regulus, shown standing with a group of Roman citizens, including priests and a vestal virgin. The painting captures the emotional intensity of the scene, with the figures' gestures and expressions conveying a sense of sorrow and admiration for Regulus's self-sacrifice. The landscape setting adds to the dramatic atmosphere of the event.
