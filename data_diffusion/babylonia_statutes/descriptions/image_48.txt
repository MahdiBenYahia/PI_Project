This image depicts a bas-relief sculpture of a female figure, likely representing a fertility goddess, possibly Ishtar or a related deity, from the Babylonian culture, dating back to the Old Babylonian period, circa 18th century BCE. The context is religious or votive, intended to invoke fertility or protection. The purpose was likely to serve as a representation of the goddess, symbolizing her power and influence. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Babylonian, and the figure, if interpreted as Ishtar, would be a significant deity associated with love, fertility, and war. The sculpture, characterized by its stylized representation of the female form with clasped hands and a serene expression, embodies the artistic conventions and religious significance of goddesses in Babylonian art. It reflects the importance of fertility and divine protection in Mesopotamian society.
