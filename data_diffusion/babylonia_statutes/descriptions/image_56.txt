This image depicts a bas-relief sculpture of a griffin-like creature, likely from the Neo-Assyrian period, specifically from the palace of Sargon II in Dur-Sharrukin, dating back to the 8th century BCE. The context is royal art, intended to glorify the king and depict scenes of power and ritual. The purpose was to visually communicate the might and divine favor of the Assyrian rulers. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Assyrian, and the griffin-like creature, a mythological being, is not a historical character, but a powerful symbol of protection and strength. The sculpture, with its stylized wings, intricate details, and composite features, embodies the artistic conventions and cultural significance of Assyrian art. It reflects the importance of protective deities and mythological creatures in Mesopotamian iconography.
