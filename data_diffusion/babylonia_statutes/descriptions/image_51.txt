This image depicts a sculpture of an Assyrian Androcephalous Bull, a protective deity from the Neo-Assyrian period, specifically from the palace of Sargon II in Dur-Sharrukin, dating back to the 8th century BCE. The context is a small-scale representation, possibly a decorative or commemorative piece, inspired by the monumental guardian figures that adorned palace entrances. The purpose was to visually communicate the might and divine favor of the Assyrian rulers, even in a smaller, domestic setting. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Assyrian, and the Androcephalous Bull, a mythological being with a human head and bull's body, is not a historical character, but a powerful symbol of protection and strength. This sculpture, with its stylized beard, intricate details, and composite features, reflects the artistic conventions and cultural significance of Assyrian art.
