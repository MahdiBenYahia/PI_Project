This image depicts the Lion of Babylon, a significant artifact from the Neo-Babylonian period, circa 6th century BCE, under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. The context is a monumental sculpture, likely serving as a symbol of royal power and protection, situated along the processional route leading to the Ishtar Gate. The purpose was to visually assert the authority and grandeur of the Babylonian Empire. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Babylonian, and while the lion itself is a symbolic representation rather than a historical character, it embodies the power associated with Nebuchadnezzar II, known for his architectural achievements in Babylon. The sculpture reflects the artistic style and cultural significance of lions in Babylonian iconography, representing strength and dominion.
