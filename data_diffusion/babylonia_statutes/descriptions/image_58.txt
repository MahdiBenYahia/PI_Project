This image depicts a sculpture of a figure, possibly representing Ishtar, a prominent goddess in Babylonian culture, dating back to the Neo-Babylonian period, circa 6th century BCE. The context is a representation of a deity, intended to invoke her power and protection. The purpose was likely religious or votive, serving as an object of worship or devotion. The culture represented is Mesopotamian, specifically Babylonian, and the figure, if interpreted as Ishtar, is a significant deity associated with love, fertility, and war. The sculpture, characterized by its stylized representation of the goddess with a headdress, a flounced robe, and a lion at her feet, embodies the artistic conventions and religious significance of goddesses in Babylonian art. It reflects the importance of Ishtar and her influence in Mesopotamian society.
