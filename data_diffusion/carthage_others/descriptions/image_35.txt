Titre: Tile with Daniel in the Lion's Den

Description: This image shows a terracotta tile with a lion motif, potentially titled "Lion Relief Tile," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. The context suggests it's a decorative or possibly votive object, reflecting the artistic and potentially symbolic practices of the time. The purpose might have been to serve as a decorative element, a votive offering, or a small architectural detail. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Punic or Roman influence, possibly ancient times. The culture represented is likely a blend of these influences, drawing from Punic and Mediterranean artistic traditions. The lion motif, with its stylized depiction, suggests a connection to ancient artistic and cultural practices, possibly representing strength or power. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted in a detailed manner, the tile's presence and potential symbolism suggest a connection to the beliefs and practices of people in ancient Carthage. The rough texture of the terracotta and the lion's form are indicative of the period's artistic style.
