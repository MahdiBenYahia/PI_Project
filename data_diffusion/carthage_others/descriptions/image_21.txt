Titre: Lamp Mold with Christogram

Description: This image depicts a stone mold, potentially titled "Oil Lamp Mold with Christogram," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. The context suggests it's a tool used for crafting terracotta oil lamps, reflecting the manufacturing and possibly religious practices of the time. The purpose was to create oil lamps, shaping the clay with the mold, and potentially to express Christian faith through the Christogram symbol. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Roman or Byzantine influence, possibly early Christian times. The culture represented is likely early Christian, drawing from Roman and Mediterranean influences. The Christogram, a monogram for Christ, suggests a connection to Christianity. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted, the mold's presence and symbol suggest a connection to the religious practices of people in early Christian Carthage. The rough texture of the stone and the clearly defined Christogram indicate the mold's function and potential significance.
