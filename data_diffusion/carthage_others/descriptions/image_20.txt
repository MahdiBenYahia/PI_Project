Titre: Oil Lamp Reflector with Adam and Eve

Description: This image depicts a terracotta roundel or disc, potentially titled "Adam and Eve," an artifact likely from the Carthage National Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. The context suggests it's a small, possibly votive or decorative object, reflecting the artistic and potentially religious practices of the time. The purpose might have been to serve as a religious token, a decorative element, or a small offering. The period is difficult to ascertain precisely without more information, but the style might indicate a historical era when Carthage was under Roman or Byzantine influence, possibly early Christian times. The culture represented is likely early Christian, drawing from Roman and Mediterranean influences. The depiction of two figures, possibly Adam and Eve, suggests a connection to biblical narratives. While there are no recognizable historical characters depicted in a detailed manner, the roundel's presence and potential subject matter suggest a connection to the religious beliefs of people in early Christian Carthage. The simple, stylized figures and the roundel's form are indicative of the period's artistic style.
